This package specifies the types and constants commonly used for window events.
It is heavily inspired by [glfw][] and [go.wde][].

The goal is to make window event handling interoperate well between various
packages, even though this may be a [self defeating purpose][].

[go.wde]: https://github.com/skelterjohn/go.wde/
